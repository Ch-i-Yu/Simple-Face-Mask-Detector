### TechStack/Framework
- OpenCV
- Keras(Tensorflow)
- MobileNetV2
    - Optimizer: Adam
    - Loss: Binary Crossentropy
    - Metrics: Accuracy
- Caffe-based Face Detector

### Dataset
The dataset was created by Prajna Bhandary.<br>
The dataset consists of 1,376 images belongs to two classes:<br>

- with_mask: 690 images<br>
- without_mask: 686 images<br>

The images used were real images of human faces, however artificial face masks were added to create an artificial (but still real-world applicable) dataset.

### Prerequisties
All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file `requirements.txt`(TBC).

### Results
The model gave 98% accuracy for Face Mask Detection after training.<br>
See also in the following accuracy/loss training curve plot:

### Working
1. To train the Face-Mask Detector, execute the following sample command:
   `python train_detector.py -d Dataset`
2. To detect face masks in an single image, execute the following sample command:
   `python predict_image.py -i .\Examples\Images\image-01.jpg`
3. To detect face masks in video streams, execute the following sample command:
   `python predict_video.py`

### Inspiration
This simplified, hello-world like project for a greenhand in Computer vision is inspired by the efforts of **Adrian Rosebrock** and **Prajna Bhandary**.

### Special Thanks to...
Thanks for my awesome guys, **Xiyu L.** and **Feng J.** who helped me to test my tiny project and record the lovely gif in the front of this page.
